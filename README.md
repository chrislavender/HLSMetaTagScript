This is an old tool from a previous project.

Problem #1 
I needed a simple way to take an .mp4 video encoding, segment it using Apple's HLS tools and stamp it
with a series of timed meta tags which where generated from FCP7.


Problem #2
Then I need a way to upload all those files to an Amazon s3 bucket.


The solution was to write these two Python scripts. If you are using HLS and doing your own encoding and segmenting, this could come in handy.
Shoot me a message and let's talk about making it more generic.
