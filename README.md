This is an old tool from a previous project.

Problem #1 (hls_script.py)
I needed a simple way to take an .mp4 video encoding, segment it using Apple's HLS tools and stamp it
with a series of timed meta tags which where generated from FCP7.


Problem #2 (hls_s3upload.py)
Then I need a way to upload all those files to an Amazon s3 bucket.


If you are using HLS and doing your own encoding and segmenting, this could come in handy.
Shoot me a message and let's talk about making it more generic.
